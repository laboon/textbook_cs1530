## Foreword

_"Why write another book on software engineering?  Aren't there enough out there already?"_

Sure, there are plenty of books out there on writing software.  There are plenty of books out there on architecture and design patterns.  There are plenty of books out there on concurrency in Java.  There are plenty of books out there on how to develop software in an "Agile" way.  There are plenty of books out there on interacting with stakeholders.

What I have not found - despite much searching - is a book that puts together everything you need to develop a modern software project in Java.  Just as with my previous book, _A Friendly Introduction to Software Testing_, I found that there was plenty of information out there, but it was scattered.  There are great books that go into depth on many of these topics, but few that provided a good overview.  Those that did provide overviews tended to be out of date or missing what I considered essential aspects of modern software development.  

Once again, I decided that I could either complain about it, or do something about it.  Complaining is always easier, but doing something about it is much more rewarding.  And so, dear reader, allow me to present _Software Engineering in Java_.  

In this book, we'll cover all of the topics which I cover in my course on software engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.  Over the years, I have determined what students who are about the head out in the real world of software development have not covered in their "vanilla programming" courses.  General software development details such as version control, unit testing, build systems, system architecture, and stakeholder interaction are all covered, as well as more Java-centric issues such as design patterns and dealing with concurrency.

In developing my software engineering course and this book, I looked over my old notes from courses on managing software development, software architecure, and software engineering.  I also reviewed my career in software development, which spans seventeen years (so far) in a variety of languages and for everything from simple Ruby on Rails applications to multi-million line Java applications.  This course will minimize theory and will cover practical aspects of what has been actually useful to me as a software engineer.
